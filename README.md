# Python Coding Excercise

## Data structure and Algorithm
Exercises related to data structure and algorithm are in the the folder data_str_algo

## Add Two Numbers

The goal of the project is as follows:
1. Definte data structure for linked list
2. Use linked list to represent numbers such that each node of the list is a digit. 
3. Add two numbers represented by linked list and return the result in linked list

A number is represented as follows, for example
1. 1 = [1]
2. 12 = [2, [1]]
3. 123 = [3, [2, [1]]]


## Length of Longest Substring
Goal: write a function lengthOfLongestSubstring that find the length of the longest substring in a string without repetition

for example:
1. lengthOfLongestSubstring('abc') == 3
2. lengthOfLongestSubstring('1111111') == 1
3. lengthOfLongestSubstring('112123123412345') == 5

## pascal
goal: write the program to output the pascal's triangle of height n

## classHierachy
The goal of the excercise is to write a class for logical circuits. And perform binary arithmatic operation
