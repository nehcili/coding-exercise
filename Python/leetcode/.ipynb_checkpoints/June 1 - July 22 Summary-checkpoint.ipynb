    "## Topics\n",
    "### Ordered Dict\n",
    "- LRUCache\n",
    "    - the solution class can be made OrderedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding style\n",
    "- Integer to English words\n",
    "    - divide the words in to groups of < 10, < 20, < 100, < 1000\n",
    "    - always keep ' ' at the end of a word\n",
    "    - use str.strip() to remove ' ' at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursion/Stack\n",
    "- number of islands\n",
    "\n",
    "### binary search\n",
    "- median of two sorted array\n",
    "    - split the arrays so that left and right have equal size, then try to find the median using binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap\n",
    "- meeting room II (alternative solution exists)\n",
    "    - maintain a heap of end time, where each entry is a room\n",
    "    - add float('inf') and float('-inf') to the end of the input\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy\n",
    "- meeting room II\n",
    "    - sort start and end time first\n",
    "    - use another variable to keep number of availabla rooms\n",
    "- Find the celebrity\n",
    "    - Find the candidate for celebrity first, then check this is actually the celebrity\n",
    "- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II\n",
    "    - sum all the positive increases\n",
    "- Queue Reconstruction by Height\n",
    "    - first sort descending by height h, then within each height group sort ascending by k\n",
    "    - insert each p in people into res at position k in order of the sorted input \n",
    "- Gas Station\n",
    "    - If you can't pass location i from any previous locations, you can't pass location i starting at location i\n",
    "- Partition Labels\n",
    "    - for each letter, first compute intervals [start, end] where start and end are the first and last indices where the letter occurs\n",
    "    - then the idea is: merge overlapping intervals and count the size of each merged interval\n",
    "- Remove Duplicate Letters\n",
    "    - RDL2:\n",
    "    - keep a stack for ans, a dic for how many of each letters are there\n",
    "    - at every stage, if something is already in ans, skip this iteration and count -= 1\n",
    "    - if you see a new letter, remove from ans as many letters as than are > current letter and you will see the removed letters in the future (i.e. count > 0)\n",
    "    - add the current letter to ans\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Sorting\n",
    "- Assign Cookies\n",
    "- Reorganize String\n",
    "    - count the number of each letter\n",
    "    - then use a heap to sort desending and add the letter with largest number left\n",
    "- Candy\n",
    "- Sort List\n",
    "- Insertion sort list\n",
    "- Intersection of Two Arrays\n",
    "- Valid Anagram\n",
    "    - from collections import Counter\n",
    "- Largest Number\n",
    "    - convert n to 0.nnnnnnn for key when doing sorting\n",
    "    - or use key = cmp_to_key(lambda x,y : 1 if x+y > y+x else -1)\n",
    "- Max Gap \n",
    "    - Implement the Buckets and The Pigeonhole Principle\n",
    "- K Closest Points to Origin (quick sort idea, but this is so slow)\n",
    "- Contains Duplicate III\n",
    "    - use buckets\n",
    "    - use hashtable\n",
    "- Merge Sorted Array\n",
    "    - insert the max at the back of nums1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Style\n",
    "- from collections import OrderedDict\n",
    "- (See Median of Two Sorted Array). If you need to match a few criterions, maybe try to match another specific one a priori, and try to the match the rest later. i.e. you need to make sure A and B hold. You can easily get A to hold or B to hold, but not both. Don't just focus on the case where you make A hold and try to obtain B. Maybe it is easier to get B to hold first, then to obtain A.\n",
    "- it is useful to augment your input say by float('inf'), float('-inf') to avoid boundary cases.\n",
    "- learn how to write comparison function in list.sort() or sorted. Use cmd_to_key: from functools import cmp_to_key\n",
    "- learn counting sort O(n+k) (k = base)\n",
    "- learn radix sort O(d(n+k)) (k = base, d = max length of digits)\n",
    "- learn bucket sort"
