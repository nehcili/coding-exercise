When asked what the consequences might be if the Saudis are found to be connected to the death of the columnist, who had written critically about Saudi leaders, he said, "Well, it'll have to be very severe. I mean, it's bad, bad stuff. But we'll see what happens." Earlier in the day, a leaked surveillance photo showed a member of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's entourage during several trips abroad walked into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul just before writer vanished there, drawing the kingdom's heir apparent closer to the columnist's alleged slaying. The man, identified by Turkish officials as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, was photographed in the background of Prince Mohammed's trips to the U.S., France and Spain this year.
