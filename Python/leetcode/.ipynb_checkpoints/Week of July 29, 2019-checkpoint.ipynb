    "## Review:\n",
    "- Evaluate Division\n",
    "    - read the optimal solution online\n",
    "- Split Array Largest Sum\n",
    "    - Binary search + greedy (greedy is used to check if can divide into m parts with sum at most m)\n",
    "- Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum   \n",
    "    - need a nonlocal variable to store the max sum of the TWO substrees (use preorder traversal)\n",
    "    - just do usual recursion to find 2 things: \n",
    "        - largest path sum of the current subtree (this is the nonlocal var) (preorder traversal makes this the max sum of the TWO subtrees when returned to parent node)\n",
    "        - largest sum with a path starting at the current node and is in ONLY one of the subtrees (can be the empty path)\n",
    "- Remove Invalid Parentheses\n",
    "    - essentially recursion brute force\n",
    "    - can compute the number of ( and ) which needs to be removed. This optimize the algo a bit\n",
    "    - <b>read pro solutions</b>\n",
    "- Palindrome Pairs\n",
    "    - hashtable\n",
    "- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n",
    "    - use start and end pointers\n",
